# React DnD Chess Board Game
This is a simple chess board that allows you to drag and drop a
Knight piece on the valid squares.

This is a little project I made following this [tutorial](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/docs/tutorial)
in order to learn how to implement the ReactDnD library
for Drag and Drop components.

It was funny, so I recommend you to try it by yourself. In the
tutorial are some intentional missed/omitted code so if you get
lost, you can take a look at this repo to figure out and get
some ideas.

# Play it
Just run this command at the root of the project
```
yarn start
```

I'm using the Cosmos Playground to pre-visualize the components
I'm writing and test its behavior. To run the Playground just
run this command
```
yarn cosmos
```
